    "description": "I found my interest in computer science through restarting my education in community college. It was the courses I took in mathematics that guided me towards my love for problem solving. This was beginning of a snowball effect where I developed a strong passion towards engineering. A computer to me is my most powerful tool inwhich I can create something that can make the world a little bit better for everyone.",

    "bio": "I'm not someone who found a way to solve a problem. I'm someone who just wants to make something that can make the world a little bit better for everyone. I wasn't the smartest person in any of my classes, However I work hard. I don't have that throught process anymore of \"I should do this\", \"I need to do that\", I think in the sense of \"I have to do this\", \"I have to get this done\". This is the thought process and work ethic that defines me. I don't care how hard something is, I'm going to get it done.",
